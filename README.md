### Quick Overview

This is my pet project where I just throw my ideas together. I'm trying to have stuff that other clients don't but would benefit my gameplay. I kinda just kept building on to this without any framework, so I apologize for the horrendous code. Maybe I'll fix it later...

Mods include: colored book titles, stalker mod (view players in 2b2t queue), unicode keyboard, packet canceling and visualization, hover-viewing maps and books, and more.

Please note that this is a Beta mod and errors may occur. For any comments, questions, or concerns feel free to make an issue or message me on discord (**TheAlphaEpsilon#7015**), or join [here.](https://discord.gg/myqngze)
